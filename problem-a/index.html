        Haiji Kiyose is from the Japanese Television Series: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_with_the_Wind">
        Run with the Wind</a> (Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru). He is a senior and 
        the leader of Kansei University's track and field club. With a strong
        spirit, he is well loved by watchers of the show.

        I like Haiji Kiyose for 3 reasons:
        <ul>
            <li class="special"> He always thinks about the members on his team</li> 
            <li> He respects everyone around him</li>
            <li> He is driven to reach his goal</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
